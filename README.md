## ü¶ñ About Me
I'm Nicol√°s G√≥mez ‚Äî currently working as a **Salesforce Senior Analyst** at **Amrize**. I'm actively building the foundation to transition into a **Salesforce Integration Developer**, combining cloud technologies, automation, and data engineering.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Focus
I'm focused on developing real-world skills in:

- Salesforce adminsitration skills to handle company's resources effectively and efficiently.
- Salesforce development with Apex and Flow, including external integrations.
- Data pipelines using API's that connect Salesforce with external platforms and services.

My goal is to design and implement integration pipelines that bridge Salesforce with cloud ecosystems (AWS, Azure, GCP), while documenting everything with clean code, diagrams, and tutorials.

## üß† Learning Goals
Build secure and scalable Salesforce solutions in enterprise environments.
Master software architecture patterns for automation and data workflows.
Deepen my knowledge of AWS core services for integration and backend development using Python and Go.
Contribute to open source projects like PySpark (Python) or Kubernetes (Go) to strengthen my backend and infrastructure skills.
